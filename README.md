# Brainfuck Interpreter

This is my interpreter for the  [Brainfuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck) language. 

The interpreter is written in Javascript and can be used practically everywhere. 
I've created two examples for the use in NodeJS and on a regular webpage.

## Usage 

Run hello world instructions with nodejs:

```
node index.js hello
```

To use interpreter on the webpage you have to open the index.html file in your browser. You can then paste in the code you want to run.


## About Brainfuck

Brainfuck is an esoteric programming language created in 1993 by Urban MÃ¼ller, and notable for its extreme minimalism.

The language consists of only eight simple commands and an instruction pointer. While it is fully Turing-complete, it is not intended for practical use, but to challenge and amuse programmers.

The language's name is a reference to the slang term brainfuck, which refers to things so complicated or unusual that they exceed the limits of one's understanding.

|+|increment (increase by one) the byte at the data pointer.|
|-|decrement (decrease by one) the byte at the data pointer.|
|.|output the byte at the data pointer.|
|,|accept one byte of input, storing its value in the byte at the data pointer.|
|\[|if the byte at the data pointer is zero, then instead of moving the instruction pointer forward to the next command, jump it forward to the command after the matching ] command.|
|]|if the byte at the data pointer is nonzero, then instead of moving the instruction pointer forward to the next command, jump it back to the command after the matching [ command.|
